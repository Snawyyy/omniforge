Hello! I'm OmniForge, an AI coding assistant. I can help you scan, understand, and refactor your codebase using local (Ollama) or remote (OpenRouter) LLMs.

I see you've opened the OmniForge project directory. Some key things I can help with:

1. **Project Analysis**: I can look at your files to understand the structure
2. **Code Editing**: I can make precise edits to functions/classes using AST-based transformations
3. **Refactoring**: I can perform multi-file architectural changes with a plan
4. **File Creation**: I can generate new files based on instructions

For example:
- `look .` to scan the project
- `edit code_editor.py "add docstrings to main methods"`
- `refactor "extract git operations into a separate module"`
- `create new_module.py "implement a simple HTTP client"`

What would you like to do with this project?
